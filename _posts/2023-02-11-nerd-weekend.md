memories:
  - "Smith and the bloody &quot;trout in pussy&quot; video"
  - "Spiffy wouldnâ€™t shut up about how cold it was going to get in winter so instead of creating a nice warm environment for his colonists in his base he decided to send them off on a caravan trip in the freezing cold, eventually decided to settle at Toby's base and was put in charge of using a geyser vent to run a hydroponics operation. He build so many hydroponic basins there was no energy to run heaters."
  - "Hugh had a super awesome defence setup in the side of his mountain. Was an absolute fortress until he dug out the other side of his mountain and then it was all downhill from there. He "borrowed" (at least two?) of Ian's star colonists and got them killed one after the other."
  - "Toby had toxic fallout, and all the horses hid in one square of overhang from his roofline"
  - "Toby's fucking horrible base walls where nothing joined, and he made a 4-way door"
