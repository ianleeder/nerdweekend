memories:
  - "&quot;Weekend&quot; happened by chance!"
  - "Many problems trying to get RimWorld working.  Fucking Steam."
  - "Played a mountainous forest biome without Dave.  Smith tried to attack the insects and was down within 30 seconds of starting the game!"
  - "Toby had the giggles about this for the rest of the night.  To be fair, it was fucking funny"
  - "Played a desert biome, and Ian was hit with multiple heatwaves.  57&deg;C+"
  - "Smith sent colonists to help Ian, and they got downed also"
  - "So much catatonics.  Always followed (slowly) by death"
  - "The same colonoists being buried, and then <em>dug up again</em>, multiple times"
  - "Ian fighting off <em>numerous</em> raids with only a non-violent colonist.  Although he did manage to go on a murderous rampage and kill a prisoner..."
  - "Ian being saved by his pack of tame iguanas"
  - "Toby had a colonist kidnapped"
  - "Toby had <em>another</em> colonist being kidnapped, so he put his non-violent colonist in the doorway to block the kidnapper.  Kidnapper dropped the downed colonist and ran!"
  - "Near the end, Ian and Toby trading colonists back and forth depending on requirements (need a doctor/warden/etc)"

summary: "Smith set a new record for downing 2 colonists: 30 seconds!"
