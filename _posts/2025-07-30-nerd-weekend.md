date_range: "31-03 Aug 2025"
venue: "Hugh's house (Sunbury)"
games:
  - "RimWorld"
  - "Factorio"
memories:
  - "Hugh had a bidet/arse-washer toilet seat, with heated water, pulsing jet, and laser-targeting"
  - "Smith didn't bring any batteries for the wireless mouse, or any cables for the monitor. Even after Ian provided a video cable <em>and</em> a power cable, Smith finally realised the monitor needed a powerpack."
  - "Toby sat on top of 3 couch cushions to elevate himself high enough above the makeshift mousepad"
  - "Smith was on the online dating apps, with Dave and Hugh having a crack. Yuko was very interested in this..."
  - "Yuko had so much fun swiping on Smith's dating app, she wanted to see what it looked like when swiping men. So she created an online dating profile (catfishing with photos from 10 years ago)."
  - "Yuko had so much fun with her own dating profile, she started swiping yes on matches. I don't think she fully understood there was a real man on the other end getting excited to match with a pretty young lady. Smith did not approve."
  - "Thursday night was a BIG night, and didn't end until around 05:30. Hugh was playing guitar for the last 2-3 hours of it."
  - "Dave got Smith riled up about AI. Smith nearly broke Dave's monitor 'bending' it. Smith fell off his chair and knocked over a television."
  - "Ian and Hugh tried to explain RimJobWorld to Smith, and against all expectations he wasn't excited"
  - "After a big night on Thursday, everyone (except Ian) needed to either go for a walk, have a nap, or both.  Except they were staggered, so Ian sat at his computer most of Friday watching people come and go, with never a full party to play."
  - "Thursday playing an existing game of Rimworld (no DLC)"
  - "Friday playing a new game of Rimworld with Biotech. Starting with Sanguophages, and trying to have babies."
  - "Saturday (and Sunday) playing Factorio."
  - "<em>Sacks</em> of potato chips. 1kg! Thanks Costco. Hugh thought 3 would be enough, Toby demolished 2 in the first night"
  - "Drank half the beer in the first night, and almost the whole 1.75L bottle of Jim Beam"
